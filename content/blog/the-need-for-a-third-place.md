## That Feeling

It started with this Tweet from [@donni](https://twitter.com/donni). While funny, also deeply resonated with me.

Even prior to the COVID-19 pandemic I felt this need to get away from where I live and where I work. Just to exist in another place with other people. A place where I didn't have responsibilities. A place where I didn't have to clean or do chores at. A "third place".

Upon further investigation, this is not an original feeling, in fact quite common:

> In sociology, the third place refers to the social surroundings that are separate from the two usual social environments of home ("first place") and the workplace ("second place"). Examples of third places include churches, cafes, clubs, public libraries, bookstores or parks.

## The Struggle

In a post-pandemic work-from-home world, the "first place" and "second place" become merged for some. For some it can become far too easy to stay in the same location for an entire day, not stepping outside or seeing other people.

After the long day of responsibilities from work, home life, and children I find myself pulled by the "third place" most evenings. For me this typically results in a walk to discover the neighborhood and/or a visit to a nearby pub or brewery.

For some, this could come as an online community. For me it's not enough (or I haven't given it a fair shot) but after spending my day (aka "second place") online all day, the idea of going online to hang out has lost its appeal. Similarly, playing multiplayer games oddly enough adds too much pressure to the "third place" by adding a competitive or task-driven agenda.

Having grown up in time when hanging out at a mall was an acceptable activity, it's been challenging to watch that disappear. For teenage me, this was a perfect "third place" that we've watched slowly disappear.

Having moved to Seattle in 2013, I definitely experienced the Seattle Freeze™️ -- the difficulty with making new friends in the U.S. city of Seattle, Washington. The existence of, and knowledge of, a "third place" could definitely help individuals in this situation.

## The Third Place

The concept of Ray Oldenburg's "third place" has been summarized into eight characteristics:

1. **Neutral ground**: Occupants of third places have little to no obligation to be there. They are not tied down to the area financially, politically, legally, or otherwise and are free to come and go as they please.
1. **Leveler (a leveling place)**: Third places put no importance on an individual's status in a society. One's socioeconomic status does not matter in a third place, allowing for a sense of commonality among its occupants. There are no prerequisites or requirements that would prevent acceptance or participation in the third place.
1. **Conversation is the main activity**: Playful and happy conversation is the main focus of activity in third places, although it is not required to be the only activity. The tone of conversation is usually light-hearted and humorous; wit and good-natured playfulness are highly valued.
1. **Accessibility and accommodation**: Third places must be open and readily accessible to those who occupy them. They must also be accommodating, meaning they provide for the wants of their inhabitants, and all occupants feel their needs have been fulfilled.
1. **The regulars**: Third places harbor a number of regulars that help give the space its tone, and help set the mood and characteristics of the area. Regulars to third places also attract newcomers, and are there to help someone new to the space feel welcome and accommodated.
1. **A low profile**: Third places are characteristically wholesome. The inside of a third place is without extravagance or grandiosity, and has a homely feel. Third places are never snobby or pretentious, and are accepting of all types of individuals, from various different walks of life.
1. **The mood is playful**: The tone of conversation in third places is never marked with tension or hostility. Instead, third places have a playful nature, where witty conversation and frivolous banter are not only common, but highly valued.
1. **A home away from home**: Occupants of third places will often have the same feelings of warmth, possession, and belonging as they would in their own homes. They feel a piece of themselves is rooted in the space, and gain spiritual regeneration by spending time there.

For me, all of these hit the mark perfectly. Being part of a community, I love the risk of meeting neighbors by chance.
