I took inspiration from Isaac Hepworth and _____ to create my own working with file. At first glance this is a handy tool to share "how I work" but it describes so much more.

It felt appropriate to utilize [GitHub's profile README](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) to share details about me both personally and professionally.

## About me

This section is valuable for sharing something about you on a personal level -- the personal aspects of working with other humans can sometimes get lost in the day-to-day of completing work items. Sharing communications preferences (both time and medium) can help set expectations with coworkers. Finally, sharing values and passions can help communicate where your priorities and expectations sit.
