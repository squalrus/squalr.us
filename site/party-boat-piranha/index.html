        <p>Side-scrolling shooter where the player defends their party boat from airborne piranhas.</p>
        <p>By: squalrus</p>
        <h2 id="concept">Concept</h2>
        <p>A pontoon boat filled with partying twenty-somethings is cruising down a river. The boat includes men and
            women in
            bathing suits, a keg of beer, inner tubes, a radio playing party music, and one rad dude at the bow of the
            boat with
            a t-shirt cannon.</p>
        <p>Suddenly the partygoers find themselves in trouble as piranhas start jumping out of the water flying toward
            the boat.
            Thinking on his feet, the rad dude takes aim with the t-shirt cannon and starts firing t-shirts at the
            oncoming
            piranhas. Every piranha hit with a t-shirt becomes wrapped in one and falls back into the water.</p>
        <p>The party boat continues down the river in an attempt to escape the never-ending barrage of fish, but how
            long can
            they fend them off?</p>

        <h2 id="user-interface">User interface</h2>
        <h3 id="title-screen">Title screen</h3>
        <p>Depicts the scene of a party boat cruising down a river with the game title and a &quot;click to start&quot;
            text.
        </p>
        <h3 id="game-over-screen">Game over screen</h3>
        <p>As an homage to Grand Theft Auto, once the party boat hits 0% health, the screen shows &quot;wasted&quot;.
            The score
            will be recapped on a stats screen and the player will be brought back to the title screen.</p>
        <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
        <p>As piranhas fly out of the water at varying arcs and velocities, the player takes aim by tapping in the
            direction the
            t-shirt cannon will fire.</p>
        <p>The user must manage their t-shirt inventory and overall boat health while trying to get the highest score by
            hitting
            the most piranhas, getting combos, and landing multipliers (same piranha, multiple t-shirts).</p>
        <h2 id="assets">Assets</h2>
        <p>The 2D assets list for PBP that are located in <code>/Unity/Assets/Art</code>. Any <strong>STRETCH</strong>
            indicates
            that an asset is not strictly required for v1.0, based on time, availability, and complexity.</p>
        <p>During design the assets are being managed in <a
                href="https://www.dropbox.com/home/Chad%20Schulz">Dropbox</a>.</p>

                red-bellied
                piranha, that has both a closed and open mouth state in a single sprite sheet.</li>
            <li><code>piranha_alt.png</code> : <strong>STRETCH</strong> An alternate version of the main piranha.</li>
            <li><code>piranha_shirt.png</code> : The main piranha, but a bit dazed and wearing one of the t-shirts that

        </ul>
        <h3 id="boat">Boat</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><code>boat.png</code> : The party boat the player is riding on. This boat has several beverages strewn
                about,
                covered with party-goers, and has a protagonist that holds the t-shirt cannon.</li>
            <li><code>boat_life_25.png</code> : <strong>STRETCH</strong> Same boat, but after taking damage that
                represents 25%
                health. The hull has taken more severe damaged and some of the people on the boat have now become
                bloody.</li>
            <li><code>boat_life_50.png</code> : Same boat, but after taking damage that represents 50% health. The hull
                is
                damaged and some of the people on the boat have become bruised.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="backgrounds">Backgrounds</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><code>background_back.png</code> : The parallax background back layer. Darker in color, silhouettes
                mostly of
                trees and environment.</li>
            <li><code>background_fore.png</code> : <strong>STRETCH</strong> The parallax foreground layer. Blurred
                vegetation
                that gives an even further level of depth.</li>
            <li><code>background_front.png</code> : The parallax background front layer. Tree line, bank, and water --
                primary
                environment layer in vivid detail.</li>
            <li><code>background_mid.png</code> : The parallax background middle layer. Less feature-rich environment
                with some
                level of noticeable detail.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><code>cannon.png</code> : The t-shirt cannon held by the player that can move/rotate independently of

                boat.
                Alternatively the boat asset could be a sprite and have the splashing built into the animation of the
                boat.</li>
            <li><code>splash_generic.png</code> : <strong>STRETCH</strong> A generic splash animation in the form of a
                sprite
                that could be used for items entering/exiting the water.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="miscellaneous-assets">Miscellaneous assets</h3>
